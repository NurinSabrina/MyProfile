        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

            <p> My name is Nurin Sabrina Binti Azauddin . I am from Perlis the northern state in Malaysia . I am studying in University of Terengganu Malaysia </p>
            <p>This is my University's History</p>
            <p>
                Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) started as the Universiti Sains dan Teknologi Malaysia College (KUSTEM) with a Fisheries and Ocean Science Center in 1979,
                which provides training facilities for students of the Fisheries and Ocean Science Program in addition to providing research facilities for lecturers.
                
                Through the restructuring of academic programs at UPM, the entire Faculty of Fisheries and Ocean Science has been moved to Terengganu and given a new name, 
                the Faculty of Applied Science and Technology (FSGT) from June 1996. 
                Also established are the Faculty of Science and Professional Arts (FSSI) and the School of Matriculation (PPM).
                
                From June 1996, this campus has been recognized (internally by UPM) as a center of responsibility and named Universiti Putra Malaysia Terengganu Branch (UPMT) and
                headed by a Rector (designate).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Cabinet in its meeting on 5 May 1999 agreed to approve the proposed establishment of the Terengganu University College (KUT) based on
                Universiti Putra Malaysia Fisheries and Ocean Science Center in Mengabang Telipot, Kuala Terengganu.
                
                The Terengganu University College (Corporation) Order 1999 (PUA 292) was passed by the Dewan Rakyat on 26 July 1999.
                KUT is the Associated Campus of UPM and students will be awarded a degree from UPM. KUT was given autonomy as the University College of Terengganu on 1 May 2001.
                
                On 1 July 2001, KUT officially changed its name to Kolej Universiti Sains dan Teknologi Malaysia with the abbreviation KUSTEM.
                
                On 1 February 2007, Kolej Universiti Sains dan Teknologi Malaysia (KUSTEM) was upgraded to a full university and rebranded as Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT).
